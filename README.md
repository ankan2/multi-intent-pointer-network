## Files and Folders

- `train.py` - python code for running PMPLITE. `dom` here refers to the Primary
Intent, and `nondom` refers to the Non-Primary Intent.
- `train.sh` is the `.sh` file to run `train.py` on several datasets.
- The other folders contain the data needed to run `train.sh` for different
datasets. The name of each folder correponds to the dataset.
